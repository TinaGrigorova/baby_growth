                By this time, most babies double their weight. From thiny arms and legs they are now sweet and fluffy, and they are getting stronger day by day. 
                As for the weight and length all babies are different and as long as they keep growing as expected and at a steady rate, don’t worry about comparing them to other babies.
                The vocal abilities continue to develop, and baby should start to experiment more with sounds and soon laugh. It’s important to encourage baby to communicate and play it will stimulate their language skills and help them with further communication. 
                Gentle gum massages are important and helpful for the baby's and the future teeth.

        <git P>If your baby hasn’t started to roll over, they will definitely start this month. 
            Baby should start to sleep through the whole night by now, of not - soon. 
            Their teeth will start growing up as well, on which cases most babies are not taking it very well, they have temperature, sleepless nights but there are some medications that can help the babies get through with it. First their bottom central incisort will start grow, after that the upper ones and so on. Follow the chart below for more information.
           <br>
            In Conclusion:  bottom incisors (bottom front teeth) – these are usually the first to come through, usually at around 5 to 7 months
                        top incisors (top front teeth) – these tend to come through at about 6 to 8 months
                        top lateral incisors (either side of the top front teeth) – these come through at around 9 to 11 months
                        bottom lateral incisors (either side of the bottom front teeth) – these come through at around 10 to 12 months
                        first molars (back teeth) – these come through at around 12 to 16 months
                        canines (between the lateral incisors and the first molars) – these come through at around 16 to 20 months
                        second molars – these come through at around 20 to 30 months
                        Most children will have all of their milk teeth by the time they are between 2 and 3 years old.
